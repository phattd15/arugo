        <p class="h4"> What is this site ? </p>
        <p> This site helps users that want to do practice and can keep track of their progress through virtual rating
            system. You can assign yourself with initial rating, do practice based on random suggested problem and earn
            virtual rating through it. This site is inspired by my past training day, which I always wanted to have
            something like this to aid my training. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4"> How do I register ? </p>
        <p> First you must have a codeforces account. Then, to register for this site you need to show the ownership of
            the
            account by submitting a compile error solution to <a class="link-primary"
                href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1302/problem/I">1302I</a>. Please make sure that by the time you
            submit
            the request, CE is the last submission. The process is very similar to TLE discord bot. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4"> How to submit a compile error ? </p>
        <p> You can submit a nonsense solution in c++ to that problem. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4"> How to take a challenge ? </p>
        <p> First, go to the "list" section and pick up a problem of your preference. You can take a brief look at the
            problem through the link and can decide whether to take it or not (though I recommend to always take it
            without
            peeking). After that, the problem list will be locked and you will have 80 minutes to finish the challenge.
            If
            you have the problem accepted, please refresh or reaccess the challenge site to validate your solution.
            Please
            make sure that the last submission is also the accepted one. Or else, when 80 minutes mark passed and you
            could
            not solve it or you gave up, your rating will get reduced.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4"> What is my rating progress ? </p>
        <p> Your rating progress is the initial rating when you registered this account. And by taking challenges, your
            virtual rating will change and you can view the last 30 changes through the graph.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4"> I forgot my password or want to change the rating level ? </p>
        <p> Do the same as in the registration process. The site will update your new infos. </p>
    </div>
