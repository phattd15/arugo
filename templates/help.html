        <p class="h4">What is this site?
        </p>
        <p>This site helps users that want to do practice and can keep track of their progress through a virtual rating
            system. You can assign yourself with an initial rating, do practice based on random suggested problems and
            earn a virtual rating through it. This site is inspired by my past training days, which I always wanted to
            have something like this to aid my training.</p><hr>

        <p class="h4">How do I register?</p>
        <p> First, you must have a codeforces account. Then, to register for this site you need to show the ownership of
            the account by submitting a compile error solution to a certain problem that was required. Please make sure that by the time you
            submit the request, CE is the last submission. The process is very similar to the TLE discord bot. </p><hr>

        <p class="h4">How to submit a compile error?</p>
        <p>You can submit a nonsense solution in c++ to that problem.</p><hr>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4">How to take a challenge?</p>
        <p>First, go to the "list" section and pick up a problem of your preference. You can take a brief look at the
            problem through the link and can decide whether to take it or not (though I recommend taking it without
            peeking). After that, the problem list will be locked and you will have 80 minutes to finish the challenge
            at the "challenge" site. If you have the problem accepted, please refresh or reaccess the challenge site to
            validate your solution. Please make sure that the last submission is also the accepted one. Or else, when 80
            minutes mark passes and you could not solve it or you gave up, your rating will get reduced.</p><hr>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4">What is my rating progress?</p>
        <p>Your rating progress is the initial rating when you registered for this account. And by taking challenges,
            your virtual rating will change and you can view the last 30 changes through the graph.</p><hr>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="h4">What is the formula to my rating change?</p>
        <p> Incase that you successfully solve the problem, your rating will increases by $$\min(magnitude*10, \lfloor \frac{0.5*magnitude}{\frac{1.15}{1 + 10^{\frac{problem\_rating - user\_rating}{500}}}} \rfloor)$$ Else decreases by $$\min(magnitude*10, \lfloor \frac{0.5*magnitude}{1 - \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{problem\_rating - user\_rating}{500}}}} \rfloor)$$ Here, magnitude is 10, which means if you solve a problem of your own rating range, then solving 10 of it should take you 100 rating above.</p>

        <p class="h4">I forgot my password or want to change the rating level?</p>
        <p>Do the same as in the registration process. The site will update your new info.</p>
